On Windows:
using virtualenv as source:
    pip freeze > requirements.txt

Linux:
    virtualenv --no-site-packages prod_env
    source prod_env/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

When you have a requirements change: 
simply regenerate the requirements.txt file and run pip install -r requirements.txt in production.

don't have access to the Internet:
    create your own private pypi server and push your packages there.
